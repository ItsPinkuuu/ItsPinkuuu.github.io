basicaly have two sides, one top and one bottom.


The top part, the part you will see first when you enter the 
website is going to be text in the center that says "THE HUB" with a background that has a lot of
mouse pointers that will be pointing towards the users mouse position and follow it where ever it is. 
The background is going to be dark grey with light grey mouse pointers and the text will be white.


The bottom part will have a picture slider, almost like tinder where you can click a button to go to the next
picture and then a button to go to the previous picture. When you click the "image" that is on screen you will
be directed to the coresponding website.
